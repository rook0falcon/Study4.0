Before moving, try making things **automatic**. Each and every ingredient of your work can be automated and will bring a solid success. <br>

```
To have a ritual, to follow every day, every hour.
Your morning with plans and decisions.
Refocus a minute in every hour.
Close the day asking: 
Did the plan work? Note backlogs.
What strategy can I repeat or not-repeat the next day?
Do I need to update someone?
Did I progress in learning something that I wanted to?

Morning plans: Prioritize, Plan of Action, Update people, Start and continue with a deep breadth and a smile.

Now define your success. Clear goals. Stack skills. think from first principles, consistent, high-quality output. Prioritise health.
