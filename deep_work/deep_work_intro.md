You know that you are important. Your work is important. But, do you work to satisfy your potential? <br>
To satisfy your potential, understand that what you do is to be at best. It should be very very good. <br>
And ignore everything apart from work. There is vast amount of gossip, gamesmanship, socializing and procastinating. <br>
Stay Focused and don't get distracted. <br>

When you stay focused, you have to now eye for the next step. <br>
Try to finish work in the first half of the day. <br>
Do not fill up for someone else. Only do it to the extent that they get it going but not finish it up on your end. <br>
There will be people who finish of projects and scrap them to redo in a new fashion. Do not get intimated by what others do. <br>
One more thing you can do is to under promise and over deliver, but to be used not too often. But never deliver something inadequate or late. <br>
Make it bigger, reach out to a bigger understanding of the mechanism, let it be as big as the company. Make an impact at that level. <br>
Become a Sherlock version of yourself, to be ready. Get as much details of how a thing is going wrong and don't follow that path. <br>
Enjoy what you are doing. <br> 
To have right attitude you have to side with your management. <br>
Working to have a sense of achievement, don't exploit yourself. <br>
You have to never let anyone know how hard you work. <br>
To do this, no extensions, no help, no complain, no overwork, no sweat and ease out your workload.  <br>
Let your mind be in place. <br>

Smile, no need to be cool (Gangsta-style), exude confidence, develop a noticeable style, Personal Groom (every day should be like an interview day), be attractive, write, speack and look well. <br>

Now, have a plan. Else you are stuck. What is your end-goal? <br>

One-month: Current projects, deadlines, priority list, and basic routines. <br>
One-year: Planned work. <br>
Five-year: Career milestones. <br>

All the above are excerpts from a book, Rules of Work by Richard <br>

### Now you understand, it takes what it takes to get what you want. <br>

Moving to deep work, it is important to identify what you want and how it has to be done. Here, I will be putting up a framework.
